If you missed the Flappy Bird hype, here's your chance to try the best vintage knockoff.

**Features**

* üéâ good ol' div's for all the objects and graphics,
* üñ• scales perfectly on almost any screen, both mobile and desktop,
* üí© unoptimized, laggy, and not nearly as fast as a canvas implementation,
* üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è a typescript version that does almost nothing better over at [ts-floppybird](https://github.com/nebez/ts-floppybird)!

Enjoy.
